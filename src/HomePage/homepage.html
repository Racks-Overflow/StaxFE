            <p> We are here to help you create priceless moments during the trip of your dreams. We do this by helping you set, track, and accomplish a savings goal to share with a group. Once the fun begins you all can relax and know your money is ready to be spent effortlessly on the things that matter most. The steps are pretty simple:
                <ol>
                    <li> Get the boring stuff out of the way and create your account. </li>
                    <li> Use our build-a-trip questionaire to get an estimate for your next trip. Just an estimate - we don't have a crystal ball...yet. </li>
                    <li> Invite everyone! Ok...maybe not everyone but there has to be someone willing to spend time with you. </li>
                    <li> Save, save, save! Everyone contributing to the same goal in equal amounts; we like things fair and square. </li> 
                    <li>Then once you start your trip the savings account becomes a spend account that you, and whatever poor soul you dragged along, can use to pay for group activities with!</li>
                </ol> 
            No more sending money back and forth with 4-5 different apps -cause everyone always has a different one- OR forcing your poor waiter to split the bill! Pay the tab and keep the fun going!       
            </p>
